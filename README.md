# ABOUT-ME
## 👋 Hi, I’m YANAMADALA YASWANTH

I am a 2025 B.Tech graduate with a strong interest in **Digital Design and Design Verification**.

I have hands-on experience in **Verilog RTL design** and **testbench development**, and I regularly use **QuestaSim** for simulation and debugging. I enjoy understanding how digital systems work at the block and datapath level and verifying their correctness through structured testbenches.

### 🔧 Technical Skills
- Verilog HDL
- Digital Logic Design
- RTL Design & Hierarchical Modeling
- Self-checking Testbenches

### Tools
- QuestaSim
- Gvim
- vivado

### 📘 Currently Learning
- SystemVerilog
- UVM (Universal Verification Methodology)
- Verification of standard protocols (UART, I2C, AMBA – upcoming)

### 🛠 Projects
- **4-bit Comparator (Verilog)**  
  Hierarchical design using 1-bit comparator blocks with an exhaustive self-checking testbench.

- **GCD Accelerator**  
  Implemented datapath  and control path(FSM) using modular blocks such as mux, comparator, registers, and subtractor.

- **RISC-V Processor**  
  Designed and understood instruction flow through register file, ALU, and datapath multiplexing.

### 🎯 Career Objective
To start my career as a **Design Verification Engineer**, where I can apply my RTL and verification skills, learn industry-standard methodologies, and grow as a verification professional.

📌 I use this GitHub profile to document my learning and projects as I progress toward industry-ready DV skills.
